# Welcome to the Yuberz quickshell config!

The code for this is forked from [caelestia shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell), obviously.

## Changes include...
- Disabling "Active Window"
- Adding icons for zen-browser, lutris, github desktop, steam, and kew
- Recoloring a lot of items to better match the color palette of yellow primary, blue secondary, red tertiary
- Adding day of the week to time display on dashboard
- Multi-color clock
- Changed various icons to the Arch Linux logo
- ...more stuff I probably forgot about!
